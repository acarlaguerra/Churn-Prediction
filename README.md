This project explores the effectiveness of Deep Learning on tabular data compared to robust baselines architectures to predict customer attrition (churn) in the telecommunications industry. The following classifiers were used:

Deep Learning & Transformers (State-of-the-Art)

STab (Self-Attention based Transformer): Applies attention mechanisms to capture complex feature interactions in tabular data.

TabPFN2: A Prior-Data Fitted Network that approximates Bayesian inference, optimized for small-to-medium tabular datasets.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): A fully connected feedforward neural network acting as a strong deep learning baseline.

Random Forest: A bagging ensemble method to reduce overfitting.

Gradient Boosting: A boosting technique focused on minimizing bias.
